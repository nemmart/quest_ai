// The page class is designed to be subclassed.  The idea is that you could have two subclasses, one
// which uses a java byte[] array to store the page data.  This would be used to store code pages and
// private data pages like the stack.   The second subclass could use MappedByteBuffer, which would
// automatically store the data on disk when the page was swapped out.  This could be used to handle
// the DG shared files, although the current implementation doesn't do that right now.
