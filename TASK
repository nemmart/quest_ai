This project contains several components.  It contains an emulator for a Data Generate 32-Bit Eagle computer and
and an emulator for a minimal set of AOS/VS operating system calls.  The operating system calls are mapped to
Windows/C++ calls.  The emulators are written in Java and can be found in the Source directory.

The project also includes a game called QUEST.  Quest consists of two processes that must be running simultaneous
on the emulation.  QUEST and QUEST_SERVER.  They communicate through shared memory that is mapped into each process.
The binary program can be found in the QUEST folder: QUEST.PR and QUEST_SERVER.PR.  The associated symbol tables for
the two programs are QUEST.ST and QUEST_SERVER.SR.

The project has a simple disassembler and symbol table dumper.  Quest has been disassembled into quest.dis and the
symbols have been dumped into quest.symbols, likewise for quest_server.

The original Quest program was probably written in either F77 or PL/I and compiled to the .PR files.  The original 
source code for Quest and Quest_Server has been lost.  Your project is to try to reverse engineer the .PR file 
back to some source code that could be compiled.  

Some useful information.  Within the Source folder, you'll find hw which is the instruction set emulation.  You'll
also find os which contains the emulation of the operating system.  Debug has tools for loading and dumping information
about the programs.  The Docs folders contains documentation about AOS/VS system calls and the instruction set.

Do you have questions that I can answer?  Can you write a plan for how you would tackle this project?
