Welcome to Quest!

Compile:
   cd Source
   javac debug/*.java hw/*.java os/*.java q/*.java Launch.java
   jar -cvf ../quest.jar *.class */*.class
   cd ..

Run:
   java -cp quest.jar Launch QUEST QUEST_SERVER @QUEST >log
   telnet to port 8781 with a DG D200 compatible terminal

The Launch java application creates a virtual DG machine, sets up the
file system to be the contents of the QUEST directory (the first argument)
and then launches two QUEST_SERVER.PR and QUEST.PR.  The QUEST_SERVER is
a DG background process that allowed multiple players to play quest
simultaneously.  The @ before QUEST, tells Launch to wait for a connection
to port 8781, and redirect all output from the QUEST process to the telnet
session.

The game is relatively straight forward - type h for help, but be prepared
to die a lot.

To quit Quest, press "escape" (or die).  Then control-c the Java application.
When you control-c the java application, it will write the data files back
to the quest directory.

To play again, relaunch the java application and reconnect.

Enjoy!
